# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Business Problem/Objective

#### Sentiment Data:
Unstructured data on opinions, emotions and attitudes contained in sources like social media, blogs, online product reviews and customer support interactions  

#### Potential Uses of Sentiment Data
Organizations use sentiment analysis to understand how the public feels about something at a particular moment in time, and also to track how those opinions change over time.  An enterprise may analyse sentiment about:  
 A product – For example, does the target segment understand and appreciate messaging around a product launch? What products do visitors tend to buy together, and what are they most likely to buy in the future?
A service – For example, a hotel or restaurant can look into its locations with particularly strong or poor service.
Competitors – In what areas do people see our company as better than (or weaker than) our competition?
Reputation – What does the public really think about our company? Is our reputation positive or negative?  

In this project, we will focus on a famous personality review(Reputation). Specifically, we will look at public sentiment as of what people feel about the current Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi.   
Subsequent score and wordcloud has to be generated corresponding to it.
